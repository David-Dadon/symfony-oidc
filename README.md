# Symfony OIDC bundle

This bundle can be used to add OIDC support to any application. Currently it has only been tested with SURFconext OIDC.

### Composer

You can add this bundle to the `composer.json` by defining the security options: see [Composer docs](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/handling-private-packages-with-satis.md#security). 

You will need to create a new deploy key for every installation (dev or prod).
